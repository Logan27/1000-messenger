## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Phase 1 (Setup)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Phase 2 (Foundational)**: Depends on Phase 1 completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **Phase 3-13 (User Stories)**: All depend on Phase 2 completion
  - User stories can proceed in priority order: P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3
  - P1 stories (US1, US2, US3) are interdependent and should be done sequentially
  - P2+ stories can run in parallel if team capacity allows
- **Phase 14 (Polish)**: Depends on desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

**Priority 1 (P1) - Must complete in order:**
- **US1 (Authentication)**: No dependencies, start after Phase 2 ‚úÖ
- **US2 (Contact Management)**: Depends on US1 (needs authenticated users) üîó
- **US3 (Direct Messaging)**: Depends on US1 + US2 (needs contacts to message) üîóüîó

**Priority 2 (P2) - Can start after US3:**
- **US4 (Group Chats)**: Depends on US1 + US2 + US3 (extends messaging to groups) üîóüîóüîó
- **US5 (Message Management)**: Depends on US3 (needs messages to edit/delete/react) üîó
- **US6 (Presence & Typing)**: Depends on US3 (real-time features for chats) üîó

**Priority 3 (P3) - Can start after relevant P2:**
- **US7 (Read Receipts)**: Depends on US3 (extends message delivery tracking) üîó
- **US8 (Search)**: Depends on US1 + US3 (searches users and messages) üîó
- **US9 (Profile Management)**: Depends on US1 (extends user features) üîó
- **US10 (Deep Linking)**: Depends on US3 (links to chats/messages) üîó
- **US11 (Notifications)**: Depends on US3 (notifies of new messages) üîó

### Within Each User Story

**Standard Pattern:**
1. Backend repositories ‚Üí Backend services ‚Üí Backend controllers ‚Üí Backend routes
2. Frontend components (parallel) ‚Üí Frontend pages ‚Üí Frontend integration
3. WebSocket handlers (if needed)

**Parallelization Rules:**
- Tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (different files)
- Frontend and backend can proceed in parallel once contracts are known
- All repositories in a story can be built in parallel
- All React components in a story can be built in parallel

### Critical Path (MVP)

**Minimum Viable Product = Phase 1 + Phase 2 + Phase 3 + Phase 4 + Phase 5**

1. Phase 1: Setup (~2 hours)
2. Phase 2: Foundational (~2 days) ‚ö†Ô∏è BLOCKING
3. Phase 3: Authentication (~2 days)
4. Phase 4: Contact Management (~2 days)
5. Phase 5: Direct Messaging (~3 days)

**Total MVP Estimate**: ~8-10 days for single developer

---

## Parallel Opportunities

### Phase 1 (Setup) - High Parallelism
```bash
# Can run in parallel:
T001-T003 (Backend setup)
T004-T009 (Frontend setup)
T010-T018 (Infrastructure config)
```

### Phase 2 (Foundational) - Medium Parallelism
```bash
# Backend parallel groups:
T022-T025 (Config files)
T026-T029 (Utils)
T030-T034 (Middleware)
T037-T038 (Health check)

# Frontend parallel (after backend setup):
T042-T050 (Frontend services and components)
```

### Each User Story - Component Parallelism
```bash
# Example for US3 (Direct Messaging):
Backend repositories: T089, T090 (parallel)
Frontend components: T111-T115 (parallel - 5 components at once)
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (Phase 1-5: Authentication + Contacts + Direct Messaging)

**Goal**: Deliver working 1-on-1 messaging ASAP

1. **Week 1**: Complete Phase 1 (Setup) + Phase 2 (Foundational)
2. **Week 2**: Complete Phase 3 (Authentication) + Phase 4 (Contacts)
3. **Week 3**: Complete Phase 5 (Direct Messaging)
4. **VALIDATE MVP**: Two users can register, add each other as contacts, send text/image messages

### Incremental Delivery

**After MVP, add features by priority:**

1. **Week 4**: Phase 6 (Group Chats) ‚Üí Demo multi-user conversations
2. **Week 5**: Phase 7 (Message Management) ‚Üí Demo edit/delete/reactions
3. **Week 6**: Phase 8 (Presence & Typing) ‚Üí Demo real-time features
4. **Week 7-8**: Phase 9-13 (P3 features) ‚Üí Polish and completeness
5. **Week 9**: Phase 14 (Polish & Production) ‚Üí Production-ready deployment

### Parallel Team Strategy

With 3 developers (optimal split):

**After Phase 2 completes:**
- **Dev A**: Phase 3 (Authentication) ‚Üí Phase 6 (Group Chats)
- **Dev B**: Phase 4 (Contacts) ‚Üí Phase 7 (Message Management)
- **Dev C**: Phase 5 (Direct Messaging) ‚Üí Phase 8 (Presence)

Each dev owns end-to-end (backend + frontend) for their user stories.

## Notes

- All tasks include exact file paths for immediate implementation
- [P] marker indicates parallelizable tasks (different files, no dependencies)
- [Story] label maps each task to its user story for traceability
- Each user story is independently completable and testable
- Foundational phase (Phase 2) is critical - blocks all user stories
- Tests are NOT included unless explicitly requested
- Database schema defined in Phase 2 (Prisma) supports all user stories
- WebSocket infrastructure in Phase 2 enables all real-time features
- MVP deliverable after Phase 5 provides core messaging functionality
- Each checkpoint validates story independence
- Avoid: starting user stories before Phase 2 completes, skipping validation checkpoints
