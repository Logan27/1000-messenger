# T037 Implementation Summary: Health Check Route

## Task Description
Setup health check route in `backend/src/routes/health.routes.ts` as part of Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites) / Express App Setup.

## Implementation Status
✅ **COMPLETE** - Health check routes were already implemented in the codebase with three comprehensive endpoints.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Health Routes (`backend/src/routes/health.routes.ts`)
Three health check endpoints are exposed:
- **GET /health/** - Basic health check returning status, timestamp, and uptime
- **GET /health/ready** - Readiness check for Kubernetes/orchestration (503 if dependencies fail)
- **GET /health/detailed** - Detailed health info for all dependencies with messages

### 2. Health Controller (`backend/src/controllers/health.controller.ts`)
Implements three methods corresponding to the routes:

#### `health()` - Basic Check
- Returns: `{ status: 'ok', timestamp, uptime }`
- Status Code: Always 200 (unless server error)

#### `ready()` - Readiness Check  
- Checks: PostgreSQL, Redis, MinIO/S3 connections
- Returns: `{ status: 'ready'|'not ready', checks, timestamp }`
- Status Code: 200 if all healthy, 503 if any dependency fails

#### `detailed()` - Detailed Check
- Checks: PostgreSQL, Redis, MinIO/S3 with detailed messages
- Returns: `{ status: 'healthy'|'unhealthy', checks: { database, redis, storage }, timestamp, uptime }`
- Status Code: 200 if all healthy, 503 if any dependency fails

### 3. Integration (`backend/src/app.ts`)
- Health routes mounted at `/health` path
- No authentication required (standard for health endpoints)
- Positioned before API rate limiting (rate limit applies only to `/api/*`)

## Dependencies Checked
1. **PostgreSQL** - via `testConnection()` from `config/database.ts`
2. **Redis** - via `checkRedisHealth()` from `config/redis.ts`
3. **MinIO/S3** - via `healthCheck()` from `config/storage.ts`

## Changes Made
Fixed a missing import in `health.controller.ts`:
- Added `checkRedisHealth` to the imports from `config/redis`
- This function was being called in the `ready()` method but wasn't imported

## Verification
The health check endpoints follow these best practices:
- ✅ Three-level health checks (basic, readiness, detailed)
- ✅ Proper HTTP status codes (200 for healthy, 503 for unhealthy)
- ✅ Comprehensive dependency checking
- ✅ No authentication required (standard for health checks)
- ✅ Proper error handling with try-catch blocks
- ✅ Logging of failures
- ✅ Follows existing code conventions

## API Endpoints Available

### Basic Health Check
```
GET /health
Response: 200 OK
{
  "status": "ok",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
  "uptime": 123.456
}
```

### Readiness Check (for K8s)
```
GET /health/ready
Response: 200 OK (if ready) or 503 Service Unavailable (if not ready)
{
  "status": "ready",
  "checks": {
    "database": true,
    "redis": true,
    "storage": true
  },
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"
}
```

### Detailed Health Check
```
GET /health/detailed
Response: 200 OK (if healthy) or 503 Service Unavailable (if unhealthy)
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "checks": {
    "database": {
      "healthy": true,
      "message": "Database connection successful"
    },
    "redis": {
      "healthy": true,
      "message": "Redis connection successful"
    },
    "storage": {
      "healthy": true,
      "message": "Storage connection successful",
      "info": { ... }
    }
  },
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
  "uptime": 123.456
}
```

## Use Cases
1. **Load Balancer Health Checks** - Use `/health` for quick liveness probe
2. **Kubernetes Readiness** - Use `/health/ready` for readiness probe
3. **Monitoring/Debugging** - Use `/health/detailed` for troubleshooting dependency issues
4. **CI/CD Deployment Verification** - Check `/health/ready` after deployment

## Acceptance Criteria Met
- ✅ `backend/src/routes/health.routes.ts` delivers health check routes
- ✅ Routes properly integrated into Express app
- ✅ All dependencies (database, Redis, storage) are checked
- ✅ Proper HTTP status codes returned
- ✅ No authentication required for health endpoints
- ✅ Follows existing code conventions and patterns
