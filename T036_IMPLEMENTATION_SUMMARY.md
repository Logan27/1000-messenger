# T036 Implementation Summary: HTTP Server with Graceful Shutdown

## Overview
Implemented a robust HTTP server setup in `backend/src/server.ts` with comprehensive graceful shutdown capabilities to ensure zero data loss and clean resource cleanup during server termination.

## Changes Made

### File Modified
- `backend/src/server.ts` - Enhanced graceful shutdown implementation

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. HTTP Server Setup
- Creates HTTP server using Node.js `http.createServer()`
- Integrates Express app with middleware and routing
- Initializes WebSocket manager (Socket.IO) on the same HTTP server
- Starts message delivery queue processing
- Comprehensive startup sequence with proper error handling

### 2. Graceful Shutdown System

#### Shutdown Triggers
- **SIGTERM** - Kubernetes/Docker container termination
- **SIGINT** - Ctrl+C keyboard interrupt
- **uncaughtException** - Unhandled synchronous errors
- **unhandledRejection** - Unhandled promise rejections

#### Shutdown Process (6 Steps)
1. **Stop New Connections**: HTTP server stops accepting new requests
2. **Notify Clients**: WebSocket clients receive shutdown notification with timestamp
3. **Stop Message Queue**: Message delivery queue processing is halted
4. **Wait for In-Flight Requests**: 5-second grace period for active requests to complete
5. **Disconnect WebSockets**: All active WebSocket connections are gracefully disconnected
6. **Close Connections**: Database pools and Redis connections are closed

#### Safety Features
- **Duplicate Signal Prevention**: Ignores additional shutdown signals once shutdown is in progress
- **Shutdown Timeout**: 30-second hard limit to prevent hanging (force exits if exceeded)
- **Error Handling**: Each shutdown step has try-catch blocks to prevent cascading failures
- **Parallel Cleanup**: Database and Redis cleanup happen concurrently for faster shutdown
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Each step is logged with clear progress indicators

### 3. Configuration Constants
```typescript
SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT = 30000       // 30 seconds max shutdown time
GRACEFUL_WAIT_TIME = 5000      // 5 seconds for in-flight requests
```

## Technical Details

### Startup Sequence
1. Test database connection (primary + replica)
2. Connect to Redis (main, pub, sub clients)
3. Initialize MinIO/S3 storage
4. Initialize repositories (User, Chat, Message)
5. Initialize services (Session, Auth)
6. Create Express app with middleware
7. Create HTTP server
8. Initialize WebSocket manager with Redis adapter
9. Initialize and start message delivery queue
10. Start listening on configured port
11. Register signal handlers

### Shutdown Improvements Over Previous Version
- Added timeout protection to prevent indefinite hangs
- Enhanced error handling at each step
- Added uncaught exception/rejection handlers
- More granular logging with step numbers
- Better WebSocket client disconnection
- Parallel database/Redis cleanup
- Checks for server state before attempting close operations

## Benefits

1. **Zero Data Loss**: In-flight requests are allowed to complete
2. **Client-Friendly**: WebSocket clients receive notification before disconnection
3. **Predictable**: 30-second hard limit prevents hanging processes
4. **Production-Ready**: Handles all standard termination signals
5. **Observable**: Comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring
6. **Resilient**: Continues shutdown even if individual steps fail
7. **Fast**: Parallel cleanup reduces shutdown time

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing
```bash
# Test SIGTERM (simulates Kubernetes pod termination)
kill -TERM <pid>

# Test SIGINT (Ctrl+C)
# Press Ctrl+C while server is running

# Test with active connections
# 1. Start server
# 2. Connect WebSocket clients
# 3. Trigger shutdown
# 4. Verify clients receive notification
# 5. Verify logs show all 6 steps
```

### Integration Testing
- Verify message queue stops processing
- Verify active WebSocket connections receive shutdown event
- Verify in-flight HTTP requests complete within grace period
- Verify database connections are closed properly
- Verify Redis connections are closed properly
- Verify process exits with code 0 on clean shutdown

## Production Considerations

### Kubernetes/Docker
- The graceful shutdown works seamlessly with container orchestrators
- Kubernetes `terminationGracePeriodSeconds` should be set to at least 35 seconds (5 seconds more than SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT)
- Example Kubernetes configuration:
```yaml
spec:
  terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 35
```

### Load Balancer
- Ensure load balancer health checks fail immediately when server.close() is called
- Health check endpoint should return 503 during shutdown

### Monitoring
- Monitor shutdown duration metrics
- Alert if shutdowns consistently approach the 30-second timeout
- Track graceful vs forced shutdowns

## Alignment with Specifications

✅ **Task T036 Requirements Met**:
- HTTP server setup in backend/src/server.ts ✓
- Graceful shutdown implementation ✓
- Handles SIGTERM and SIGINT signals ✓
- Closes all connections cleanly ✓
- Production-ready error handling ✓

✅ **Architecture Alignment**:
- Supports horizontal scaling (stateless server instances)
- Works with Redis adapter for multi-instance WebSocket synchronization
- Ensures message delivery queue integrity during shutdown
- Maintains data consistency (waits for in-flight operations)

## Related Tasks
- T035: Express app setup (completed - used in server.ts)
- T037-T038: Health check routes (could be enhanced to return 503 during shutdown)
- T039: Socket.IO manager (integrated with graceful shutdown)
- T041: Message delivery queue (gracefully stopped during shutdown)

## Code Quality

### Linting & Formatting
- ✅ ESLint: No errors or warnings
- ✅ Prettier: Properly formatted
- ✅ TypeScript: Strict mode compilation passes
- ✅ No unused imports or variables
- ✅ Proper async/await handling with void operators

### Best Practices Applied
- Typed signal handlers (string instead of NodeJS.Signals for flexibility)
- Unknown types for error handling (instead of any)
- Proper promise handling throughout
- Comprehensive error logging
- Clean code with clear step-by-step progression

## Future Enhancements
- Add metrics for shutdown duration and success rate
- Implement health check status change on shutdown initiation
- Add configurable shutdown timeouts via environment variables
- Consider implementing drain mode (stop accepting new requests before full shutdown)
