# T023: Setup MinIO/S3 Configuration - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented comprehensive MinIO/S3 storage configuration in `backend/src/config/storage.ts` with automatic bucket management, health checks, and integration with the application startup sequence.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced `backend/src/config/storage.ts`
**Previous State:** Basic S3 client setup with minimal configuration  
**New State:** Production-ready configuration module with full lifecycle management

#### New Features Added:
- **S3 Client Configuration**
  - Retry mechanism (3 attempts)
  - Force path style for MinIO compatibility
  - Proper credentials management

- **Extended S3_CONFIG Object**
  - Storage paths configuration (images, avatars, attachments)
  - Image size presets (original, medium, thumbnail)
  - Signed URL expiry settings
  - CORS configuration for browser uploads

- **Bucket Lifecycle Management**
  - `initializeStorage()`: Main initialization function
  - `checkBucketExists()`: Verify bucket existence
  - `createBucket()`: Create bucket if needed (handles race conditions)
  - `configureBucketCors()`: Set CORS rules for browser uploads

- **Health & Monitoring**
  - `testStorageConnection()`: Test S3/MinIO connectivity
  - `healthCheck()`: Comprehensive health check with status messages
  - `getStorageInfo()`: Return storage type (MinIO vs S3) and configuration

- **Error Handling**
  - Graceful handling of bucket already exists scenarios
  - CORS configuration fallback for unsupported services
  - Proper error logging throughout

### 2. Updated `backend/src/server.ts`
- Added `initializeStorage()` call to server startup sequence
- Positioned after database and Redis initialization
- Proper error handling and logging

**Initialization Order:**
1. Database connection test
2. Redis connection
3. **Storage initialization (NEW)**
4. Repository initialization
5. Service initialization
6. Server startup

### 3. Enhanced `backend/src/controllers/health.controller.ts`
- Added storage health checks to `ready()` endpoint
- Created new `detailed()` endpoint with comprehensive health information
- Includes storage type, bucket, region, and endpoint in detailed response

**New Health Endpoints:**
- `/health/ready`: Now includes storage in readiness check
- `/health/detailed`: **NEW** - Detailed health info for all services including storage

### 4. Updated `backend/src/routes/health.routes.ts`
- Added route for new `/health/detailed` endpoint

### 5. Created `backend/src/config/README.md`
Comprehensive documentation covering:
- All configuration modules (env, database, redis, storage)
- Usage examples and code snippets
- MinIO vs AWS S3 configuration differences
- Local development setup with Docker
- Production deployment guidelines
- Health check integration
- Security considerations
- Troubleshooting guide
- Performance tuning tips

## Technical Implementation Details

### Storage Configuration Structure
```typescript
S3_CONFIG = {
  bucket: string,
  region: string,
  publicUrl: string | undefined,
  endpoint: string,
  paths: {
    images: 'images',
    avatars: 'avatars',
    attachments: 'attachments',
  },
  imageSizes: {
    original: { quality: 85, progressive: true },
    medium: { maxWidth: 800, maxHeight: 800, quality: 80 },
    thumbnail: { width: 300, height: 300, quality: 75 },
  },
  signedUrlExpiry: 3600,
  cors: [...],
}
```

### Automatic Bucket Management
The system now automatically:
1. Tests connection to storage service
2. Checks if configured bucket exists
3. Creates bucket if it doesn't exist
4. Handles concurrent creation attempts (race conditions)
5. Configures CORS for browser uploads
6. Logs all operations

### MinIO vs AWS S3 Detection
The configuration automatically detects the storage type:
- MinIO: Endpoint URL contains 'minio'
- AWS S3: All other endpoints

This enables:
- Proper bucket location constraint handling
- CORS fallback for services that don't support it
- Appropriate logging and debugging information

### Health Check Response Examples

**Ready Endpoint (`/health/ready`):**
```json
{
  "status": "ready",
  "checks": {
    "database": true,
    "redis": true,
    "storage": true
  },
  "timestamp": "2025-10-28T10:30:00.000Z"
}
```

**Detailed Endpoint (`/health/detailed`):**
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "checks": {
    "database": {
      "healthy": true,
      "message": "Database connection successful"
    },
    "redis": {
      "healthy": true,
      "message": "Redis connection successful"
    },
    "storage": {
      "healthy": true,
      "message": "Storage service is healthy",
      "info": {
        "type": "MinIO",
        "bucket": "chat-images",
        "region": "us-east-1",
        "endpoint": "http://localhost:9000"
      }
    }
  },
  "timestamp": "2025-10-28T10:30:00.000Z",
  "uptime": 3600.5
}
```

## Integration with Existing Code

### StorageService Integration
The existing `StorageService` (backend/src/services/storage.service.ts) seamlessly integrates with the enhanced configuration:
- Uses `s3Client` for all S3 operations
- References `S3_CONFIG` for bucket name and settings
- Image size configurations can be used for processing
- Signed URL expiry settings available

### Environment Variables
All required environment variables are already defined in:
- `backend/src/config/env.ts` (Zod schema validation)
- `backend/.env.example` (documentation and defaults)
- `docker-compose.yml` (container configuration)

### Docker Compose Integration
The existing `docker-compose.yml` already includes:
- MinIO service configuration
- Bucket creation via minio-init service
- Proper environment variable mapping
- Health checks for MinIO service

## Backwards Compatibility
All changes are **fully backwards compatible**:
- Existing `s3Client` export unchanged
- Existing `S3_CONFIG` structure extended (not modified)
- New functions are additions (no breaking changes)
- Existing StorageService continues to work unchanged

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing
1. Start services: `docker-compose up -d`
2. Start backend: `npm run dev`
3. Check health endpoint: `curl http://localhost:3000/health/detailed`
4. Verify storage initialization in logs
5. Test image upload through StorageService

### Verification Points
- [ ] Server starts without storage errors
- [ ] Health endpoint shows storage as healthy
- [ ] MinIO console shows bucket exists (http://localhost:9001)
- [ ] CORS is configured (check MinIO console)
- [ ] Image uploads work through the API
- [ ] Signed URLs are generated correctly

### Error Scenarios to Test
- [ ] MinIO not running (should fail gracefully)
- [ ] Invalid credentials (should log error with details)
- [ ] Bucket already exists (should handle gracefully)
- [ ] Network issues (should retry and log)

## Security Considerations

### Implemented
- ✅ Credentials from environment variables (not hardcoded)
- ✅ CORS configuration restricts origins to FRONTEND_URL
- ✅ Support for signed URLs (time-limited access)
- ✅ No sensitive data in logs

### Production Recommendations
- Use IAM roles instead of access keys (AWS)
- Enable bucket encryption at rest
- Enable versioning for important data
- Set up lifecycle policies
- Use CDN with signed URLs
- Regular credential rotation

## Performance Considerations

### Optimizations Implemented
- Connection retry mechanism (3 attempts)
- Efficient health checks (cached in practice)
- Minimal bucket operations during startup
- Proper error handling to avoid cascading failures

### Scaling Notes
- S3/MinIO client is stateless and thread-safe
- Multiple backend instances can share the same bucket
- CORS configuration supports multiple origins (if needed)
- Signed URLs enable CDN caching
