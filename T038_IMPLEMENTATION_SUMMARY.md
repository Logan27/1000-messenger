# T038 Implementation Summary: Health Check Controller

## Task Description
Implement health check controller in `backend/src/controllers/health.controller.ts` as part of Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites) / Express App Setup.

## Implementation Status
✅ **COMPLETE** - Health check controller is fully implemented and integrated into the Express application.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Health Controller (`backend/src/controllers/health.controller.ts`)

The `HealthController` class implements three comprehensive health check methods:

#### `health()` - Basic Liveness Check
- **Purpose**: Quick check to verify the server is running
- **Response**: `{ status: 'ok', timestamp, uptime }`
- **Status Code**: 200 OK (always, unless server error)
- **Use Case**: Load balancer liveness probes, basic monitoring

#### `ready()` - Readiness Check
- **Purpose**: Verify all dependencies are healthy and ready to serve traffic
- **Checks**: PostgreSQL, Redis, MinIO/S3 connectivity
- **Response**: `{ status: 'ready'|'not ready', checks, timestamp }`
- **Status Code**: 200 if all healthy, 503 if any dependency fails
- **Use Case**: Kubernetes readiness probes, deployment verification

#### `detailed()` - Comprehensive Health Check
- **Purpose**: Detailed diagnostic information for monitoring and debugging
- **Checks**: PostgreSQL, Redis, MinIO/S3 with detailed error messages
- **Response**: `{ status: 'healthy'|'unhealthy', checks: { database, redis, storage }, timestamp, uptime }`
- **Status Code**: 200 if all healthy, 503 if any dependency fails
- **Use Case**: Monitoring dashboards, troubleshooting, DevOps diagnostics

## Dependencies and Integration

### Configuration Dependencies
The health controller relies on these configuration modules:
- `config/database.ts` - Provides `testConnection()` for PostgreSQL health checks
- `config/redis.ts` - Provides `checkRedisHealth()` and `redisClient.ping()` for Redis checks
- `config/storage.ts` - Provides `healthCheck()` and `getStorageInfo()` for MinIO/S3 checks
- `utils/logger.util.ts` - Provides `logger` for error and warning logging

### Route Integration
The controller is exposed via three endpoints in `backend/src/routes/health.routes.ts`:
- `GET /health/` - Basic health check
- `GET /health/ready` - Readiness check
- `GET /health/detailed` - Detailed health check

### Express Application Integration
Routes are mounted in `backend/src/app.ts`:
- Mounted at `/health` path
- No authentication required (standard practice for health endpoints)
- Positioned before API rate limiting (exempt from rate limits)

## Implementation Details

### Error Handling
- All methods use try-catch blocks for robust error handling
- Individual dependency checks have nested try-catch to prevent cascade failures
- Errors are logged with appropriate severity levels (error, warn)
- Failed checks don't crash the endpoint; they return appropriate status codes

### Health Check Strategy
The controller implements a three-tier health check strategy:

1. **Liveness** (`/health`) - "Is the server process running?"
   - No external dependencies checked
   - Always returns 200 unless server is completely down
   - Fastest response time for high-frequency checks

2. **Readiness** (`/health/ready`) - "Can the server handle requests?"
   - Checks all critical dependencies
   - Returns 503 if any dependency is unavailable
   - Used by orchestrators to route traffic

3. **Diagnostic** (`/health/detailed`) - "What's the detailed health status?"
   - Comprehensive information about each dependency
   - Includes error messages and storage metadata
   - Used by monitoring systems and operators

## API Specification

}
```

  "checks": {
    "database": true,
    "redis": true,
    "storage": true
  },
  "timestamp": "2025-10-31T14:23:45.678Z"
}
```

**Response (503 Service Unavailable when not ready):**
```json
{
  "status": "not ready",
  "checks": {
    "database": false,
    "redis": true,
    "storage": true
  },
  "timestamp": "2025-10-31T14:23:45.678Z"
}
```

### GET /health/detailed
**Response (200 OK when healthy):**
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "checks": {
    "database": {
      "healthy": true,
      "message": "Database connection successful"
    },
    "redis": {
      "healthy": true,
      "message": "Redis connection successful"
    },
    "storage": {
      "healthy": true,

## Code Quality

### Best Practices Followed
- ✅ Separation of concerns (controller, config, utilities)
- ✅ Proper error handling with try-catch blocks
- ✅ Appropriate HTTP status codes (200 for success, 503 for service unavailable)
- ✅ No authentication required (standard for health checks)
- ✅ Comprehensive logging for troubleshooting
- ✅ Follows existing code conventions and patterns
- ✅ Uses async/await for clarity
- ✅ TypeScript with proper typing
- ✅ Class-based controller matching project structure

### Architecture Alignment
- Follows the layered architecture (controllers → config → utilities)
- Integrates with existing middleware stack
- Consistent with other controllers in the codebase
- Supports horizontal scaling (stateless checks)
- Compatible with Kubernetes deployment patterns

## Use Cases

1. **Load Balancer Health Checks**
   - Use `/health` for high-frequency liveness probes
   - Fast response, minimal overhead

2. **Kubernetes Deployment**
   - Use `/health/ready` for readiness probes
   - Prevents traffic routing to unhealthy pods

3. **Monitoring Systems**
   - Use `/health/detailed` for comprehensive monitoring
   - Parse check results for alerting

4. **CI/CD Pipeline**
   - Verify deployment success with `/health/ready`
   - Automated health verification after deployment

5. **Troubleshooting**
   - Use `/health/detailed` to identify failed dependencies
   - View error messages and storage configuration

## Verification

### Compilation Status
